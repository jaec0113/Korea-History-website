    <h3>This Site</h3>
    <p>This page is just a fun project to collect and tell stories related to Korean history. Events are divided into time periods: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Legends</li>
      <li>Three Kingdoms</li>
      <li>Goryeo Dynasty</li>
      <li>Joseon Dynasty</li>
      <li>Japanese Colonial Period</li>
      <li>Modern Korea</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Events that may fall in between those periods (like Korean Empire, pre-Three Kingdom period) will be included in whichever of the above categories it best matches with.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3>Errors and Corrections</h3>
    <p>Obviously I will do my best to be factually accurate and to label anything that is disputed or potentially a story as such. However, errors are possible, and if they come to my attention I will do my best to fix them as quickly as possible.</p>
